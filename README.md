# DataFest2018-Exceeding Indeed's Needs

Data Analysis with 1 day and a half.

Group H[x]H: Hang Su, Rui Wang, Xu Lu, Yunran Chen, Junhong Chen

Institution: Duke University

In this project, we focus on how Indeed can better serve its existing customers and possibly expand the boundary of data applications in the real market.

In the first part, we give some suggestions to job seekers using the mismatch between demand and supply in different cities. (Dynamic Visualization by Junhong Chen and Xu Lu). In the second part, we aim to provide some advice for Indeed to improve the number of clicks of posted jobs for different companies. (Bayesian Hierarchical Model by Yunran Chen and Rui Wang) Finally, we try to find out how critical data given by Indeed can be incorporated into existing models to predict macro-level indices. (Fama-French Three Factor Model by Hang Su)
